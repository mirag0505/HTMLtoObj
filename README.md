# HTMLtoObj

- The program must run from the CLI by reading a file and the browser by textarea input.
  For example, running node server.js markup.html should print out the Object
  specified above. The input format is an HTML string, and browser API should not be
  used. The solution should be designed as a library that can be used/run from the
  browser or nodejs.
- You can use any Javascript library alongside your code except those that do the
  HTML-to-object parsing and conversion themselves. The main parsing and conversion
  loop must still be written by you. You can also write everything from scratch - there is no
  preference, and you will not be graded less/more if you choose not to use libraries. As
  long as the code runs, it doesn't matter.
- You have 48 hours to write the code, including tests, create a public repository, upload
  the code there, and write instructions on installing and running the code in the README
  file. Ideally, the instructions should be a simple yarn or npm install command and
  published to the npm registry.
- Send the links to your GitHub repository and NPM package by the end of the 48 hours
  to josh@symbols.app. We will clone, review, and contact you as soon as possible.
